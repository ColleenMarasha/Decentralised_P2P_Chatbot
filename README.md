  HCE311 due 12/05/25 Assignment Question 6
Design and implement a decentralized P2P chat application that allows peers to:

1. Connect to the Network: Join the P2P network and discover other peers.
2. Send Messages: Send messages to other peers in the network.
3. Receive Messages: Receive messages from other peers in the network.
4. Group Chat: Support group chat functionality.

Requirements
1. Peer Discovery: Implement a mechanism for peers to discover each other in the network.
2. Message Routing: Design a protocol for routing messages between peers.
3. Message Encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for secure communication.
4. Network Resilience: Ensure the network can handle peer failures and network partitions.

Deliverables
1. A written report (2-3 pages) describing the system architecture, peer discovery, message routing, and encryption mechanisms.
2. Code implementation of the P2P chat application (in a language of your choice, e.g., Java, Python).
3. A diagram illustrating the system architecture and peer interactions.
